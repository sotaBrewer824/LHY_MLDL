P.Sï¼š
I referred to other people's codes, blogs, and ChatGPT during the completion of my assignment. I would like to express my gratitude here. And it is worth noticing that since there's not any TA or instructor during the self-learning period,  I myself gave full marks to all my reports, so my scores are just for fun. Of course, I completed this course out of my interest in the field of machine learning and my admiration for Professor Hung Yi Le.Thanks a lot, Professor Lee! Moreover, the open source code has been approved by Professor Lee:
